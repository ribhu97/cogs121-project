## UI Updates

Login Page - Login page has remained the same for the most part except now the button names are more clear, 
the previous iteration was a bit confusing.
Profile Page - Assuming the user is new, this page now simply provides the user with the option of creating new
models/groups. Returning users will be provided with their past groups/models.
Input Page - Now users can not only drag and drop but now click on the attributes they desire. Also attributes can now be removed if the user no longer wants that specific attribute. Overall the UI is much cleaner.


## Data Visualization

For out app the best form of data visualizations were histograms displaying the students attributes. In the example screenshot it displays the distribution of the student's GPAs and number of internships. The user, a recruiter, can easily see the statistics of their current candidates and make inferences on them.
