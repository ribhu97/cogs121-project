UI Improvements
Our UI screenshots have improved in many ways. Our login screen is much more fleshed out and there is now an option for new users and returning users. A returning user simply inputs their email and password and a new user inputs their name, email, password, and company. This is an improvement from the last milestone because our last UI screens only had login capabilities for new users. Another improvement is in the user input page where the user chooses attributes and uploads their data. The new UI gives the user the ability to drag and drop attributes instead of simply choosing from a drop down menu like the way it was in the previous milestone. 

User Actions
Uploading a CSV file to the database
On the input page, click the “Enter a CSV or JSON file”, and select a file.
Choosing attributes with drag and drop and sending to the database
On the input page, drag and drop any attributes to the area below the text.
Once the above two action have been completed then click submit and it will be uploaded to the database.
